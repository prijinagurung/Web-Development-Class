        <h2> Etymology </h2>
            <p> The name "Sunday", the day of the Sun, is derived from the traditional astronomical naming system for days of the week.
                This system likely originated in the Neo-Babylonian Empire during the Jewish exile in Babylon, though the first
                direct evidence of it dates to the Roman Empire. The order has been explained in Hellenistic astrology as relating to
                planetary hours. Each of the hours of the day was assigned to one of the seven classical planets - Saturn, Jupiter,
                Mars, the Sun, Venus, Mercury and the Moon – and the planet of the first hour of each day gave its name to that day. </p>
