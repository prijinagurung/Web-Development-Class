                <p> <strong> WASHINGTON — January 22, 2026 — </strong> 
                    The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the U.S. Department of State today announced the United States’
                    completion of its withdrawal from the World Health Organization (WHO) due to the organization's mishandling of
                    the COVID-19 pandemic that arose out of Wuhan, China, its failure to adopt urgently needed reforms,
                    and its inability to demonstrate independence from the inappropriate political influence of WHO member states.</p>

            <h2> Trump threatens Canada with 100% tariffs if it 'makes a deal with China' </h2>
                <p> US President Donald Trump has threatened to slap a 100% tariff on Canadian goods if the country strikes a trade deal
                    with China. "If Canada makes a deal with China, it will immediately be hit with a 100% Tariff against all Canadian
                    goods and products coming into the U.S.A.," Trump said on Truth Social.Under the agreement reached between Carney
                    and Chinese President Xi Jinping last week, China will lower levies on Canadian canola oil from 85% to 15% by March,
                    while Canada will tax Chinese EVs at the most-favoured-nation rate, 6.1% – down from 100%.</p>
